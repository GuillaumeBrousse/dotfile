# Dotfiles

## What Is This?

This repository serves me to setup and maintain my Mac. It takes the effort out of installing everything manually. Everything which is needed to install my preffered setup of macOS is detailed in this readme. Feel free to explore, learn and copy parts for your own dotfiles.

## install

1. Update macOS to the latest version
2. [Generating SSH Keys](http://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
3. Run `install.sh` to start the installation
```shell
 sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spartDev/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```
4. Restart your computer

Your Mac is now ready to use!
